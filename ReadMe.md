This is a project that helps Localization Engineer to change <prop> tags to under <tu> tag instead of <tuv> tags.
And it changes the attribute value and name in <prop> files with old tm names.

The point of this project is to practise reading xml files in java and compile XPath and use it in Java to find and more proper nodes.
